   <p>Biryani is a South Asian rice dish typically made with rice, meat (or vegetables), </p>
   <h2>Ingredients</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>Basmati Rice</li>
    <li>Chicken</li>
    <li>Whole spices</li>
    <li>Ground Spices</li>
    <li>Yellow Onion</li>

    <li>Herbs</li>
   
   </ul>

   <h2>Steps</h2>
   <ol>
    <li><b>Marinate the Chicken: </b> the marinade by mixing yogurt, ginger, garlic, turmeric, red chili powder, garam masala, salt, mint leaves, and lemon juice.</li>
    <li><b>Crispy Onions AKA Birira :</b> On medium heat, fry the onions stirring frequently until they start to turn golden brown - about 15 to 20 minutes. Remove the fried onions from the pan, leaving the excess ghee behind as we will use this pan to cook the chicken.</li>
    <li><b>Parboi the rice : </b> a medium pot add 8 cups of water. Add cumin seeds, bay leaves, star anise, cardamom, cloves, and salt to the rice and bring the to a boil on high heat. </li>
    <li><b>Cook the chicken and layer the rice :</b> To the pan with the remaining ghee, add the marinated chicken. Cook on medium heat for 8 to 10 minutes, turning halfway through.</li>
    <li><b>Serving :</b> Serve Biryani hot with some yogurt, lemon wedges, and a cooling cucumber raita or beet raita. Pair it with Mango Lassi or Rose Lassi for a satisfying meal. Want to know my favorite dessert to pair with Biryani - its hands down the Gajar Halwa or Rice Kheer.</li>
    <li><b>Enjoy the meal</b></li>
